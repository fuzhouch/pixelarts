## Fuzhou's Pixel Art Challenge

This is a collection of my pixel art weekly challenge.
I keep it as a weekly challenge for myself starting from 2023,
when I lost my job. By that time, I started my project,
Tsetseg's Adventure,
(released at [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337770/Tsetsegs_Adventure/)
and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tsetesgs-adventure-switch/)).
As a in-parallel project, I set a challenge to myself, that I draw a painting
every week. This is a practice to help me keep the sense as a digital creator.

Starting from 2024 I rejoined my previous company, thus I lost
quite a lot of time for myself. I paused the challenge for ~8 months until Sept.
I decided to restart the challenge.
