## README

Thie folder contains all the palettes I use for weekly practice.
They are saved as JSON format, which is compatible with
[Pixelorama 1.0+](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama).

The prefix of each palettes shows its sources. As we can see, most
palettes are from [Lospec](https://lospec.com), while one of them,
prefixed XHS, are from [XiaoHongShu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/).
